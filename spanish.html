<h1><strong>Spanish Tutorial</strong> </h1>
<p><img src="images/unsplash.jpg" alt="Public square Puerta del Sol"> This tutorial repurposes material I wrote for a learning blog I kept during 2015-2016. In such blog, I reviewed materials for self-study of the Spanish language. I speak Spanish as a first language, and I used to be a Spanish tutor at that time. This particular post covers the learning website “Mi Vida Loca.” Mi Vida Loca is a funny, interesting and self-paced online program published by BBC in the UK; although, the program is currently archived. </p>


<h1><strong>Vocabulary</strong></h1>

<p>There are three vocabulary words that I’d like to review. They are all food related:</p>
<p> Vocabulary words: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Tostada</li>
  <li>Merienda</li>
  <li>Cafe con Leche</li>
</ul> 

<p>Before moving forward, I’d like you play the following short-video:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A92aLns3Hok" title="YouTube video player"> </iframe>


<h2> The table explains the meaning of the words.</h2>

 <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Word in Spanish</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tostada</td>
    <td>It means “ toast.” Spain is the only place where I have lived where you can order a slice of bread in a coffee shop. You'll hear it used in episode 2. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Merienda</td>
    <td>It means afternoon snack. It is common to have something to eat either between breakfast and lunch, or in the afternoon. </td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Cafe con Leche</td>
    <td>It is a Coffee with milk. You will hear these words in episode 2 when the characters go to a restaurant. </td>
  </tr>

<h1>Some grammar notes to consider include the following: </h1> 

<p> In Spanish, you will be using determined and undetermined articles. You can find a grammar lesson that reviews the articles  here.</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Determined articles in Spanish are “el, la, los, las”. There is only one determined article in English and it is “the”. </li>
<li>There is only one determined article in English and it is “the”. </li>
  <li>Undetermined articles in Spanish are “un, unos, una, unas.” The undetermined articles in English are “a, an”.</li>
 <li> The undetermined articles in English are “a, an”.</li>
</ol>
